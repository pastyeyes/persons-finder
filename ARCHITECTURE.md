# Clean Architecture Implementation Summary

### Clean Architecture Benefits Achieved

1. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules (use cases) depend on abstractions (ports), not concrete implementations. Adapters also depend on abstractions.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer (Adapter, Application, Domain) has distinct responsibilities.
3. **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies (ports, use cases) for unit and integration testing.
4. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer (e.g., web framework, database) have minimal impact on other layers, especially the domain and application logic.
5. **Flexibility**: Easier to swap or add new adapters (e.g., different database, message queue) or UI components.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** - Application framework (version might vary, e.g., 3.x)
- **Spring Web** - For REST controllers
- **Spring Data JPA** - Data access abstraction (optional, can be plain JPA or other persistence)
- **Hibernate** - JPA implementation (if using Spring Data JPA)
- **H2 Database** - In-memory database (for development/testing)
- **Lombok** - Reduces boilerplate code
- **Gradle** - Build tool
- **Jakarta Validation API** - For request validation
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerization (optional)

### Clean Architecture Principles Applied

- **The Dependency Rule**: Source code dependencies only point inwards. Inner circles are unaware of outer circles.
- **Entities**: Encapsulate enterprise-wide business rules. The most general and high-level rules.
- **Use Cases**: Implement application-specific business rules. Orchestrate the flow of data to and from entities.
- **Interface Adapters**: Convert data from the format most convenient for use cases and entities, to the format most convenient for some external agency such as the Database or the Web.
- **Frameworks and Drivers**: The outermost layer, generally composed of frameworks and tools such as the Database, the Web Framework, etc.
- **Constructor Injection**: Used for managing dependencies.

### Next Steps

- Potentially add security, logging, and monitoring.
